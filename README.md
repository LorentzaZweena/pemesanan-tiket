# Pemesanan Tiket

**Pemesanan Tiket** is a simple ticket booking system built using PHP (native). This project allows users to buy tickets through a basic web interface and manage their bookings easily. Itâ€™s a great starting point for learning PHP and working with server-side applications.

## Description

This project allows users to book tickets for different events, trips, or services. It is a straightforward PHP-based application, with no frameworks used, making it an excellent project for those looking to understand the fundamentals of PHP and server-side scripting.

### Features
- Users can view available tickets and book them.
- Simple PHP-based backend that processes ticket orders.
- Basic user interface with HTML and CSS.
- No database integration (local file storage or simple array-based structure).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LorentzaZweena/pemesanan-tiket.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd pemesanan-tiket
    ```

3. Upload the project files to your web server (or use a local server like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP for local development).

4. Open the project in your browser (e.g., `http://localhost/pemesanan-tiket`).

## Usage

- Open the `index.php` page in your browser.
- Browse through the available ticket options.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to select tickets and proceed to booking.
- The system will simulate booking without integrating a database (for now, the booking data is stored temporarily or displayed on-screen).

## Files

- `index.php` - The main page where users can browse and book tickets.
- `process.php` - Processes the ticket booking logic.
- `style.css` - Basic styling for the user interface.
- `ticket_data.php` (Optional) - A mock file for simulating ticket data (could be modified to include real storage options later).
